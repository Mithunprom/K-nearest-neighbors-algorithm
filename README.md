# K-nearest-neighbors-algorithm

In this Jupyter notebook, I have created a KNN algorithm from scratch. I have used a dummy dataset and an iris flower dataset to validate my model. I also created boxplots of the accuracy score for 10-folds cross-validation and compare it with the sklearn built-in package of KNNClassifiers.
