# K-nearest-neighbors-algorithm

In this Jupyter notebook, I have created a KNN alogrithm from scratch. I have used a dummy dataset and iris flower dataset to validate my model. I also created a boxplots of the accuracy score for 10-folds cross validation and compare it with the sklearn builtin package of KNNClassifiers.
